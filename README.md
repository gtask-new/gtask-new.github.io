# gtask.new

## Why I Made This Project

I created this project with the aim of providing a more enhanced experience for Google Tasks users. As someone who relies heavily on task management tools, I found myself wishing that Google Tasks had some of the advanced features offered by other platforms. So, I decided to build a project that replicates the functionalities of cal.new and doc.new for Google Tasks.

## Future Features

In the future, I plan to implement text recognition of dates and to-do lists, similar to what Todoist offers. This will allow users to easily add new tasks and deadlines by simply typing them out, without having to manually enter them into the system. Additionally, I will be adding more customization options and integrations with other task management tools.

## How to Run It Locally

To run this project locally, you will need to have Vite, React, and Tailwindcss installed on your machine. Once you have those dependencies installed, simply clone this repository, navigate to the project directory, and run npm install to install all the required dependencies. After that, run npm run dev to start the development server and view the project in your browser.

## When It Will Be Open to Everyone

Currently, this project is still in the development phase and is not yet open to everyone. However, I am working hard to complete it as soon as possible and plan to make it available to the public once it is fully functional and stable. Thank you for your interest in Gtask.new!
